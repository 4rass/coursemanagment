# Coursemanagment System
Our project with Tech-Career and AT&T.

We made a course management system that more easier
and more comfortable to manage. students can see their courses or register to course,
can search a course from all website, see the sylabus and all the schedule, 
and chat with friends and lecture from the same class . 
admin can add/delete/archive course .
add sources to course, a online test for course, option to change skin of the web site.



In the near future:
- Before admin/lecture add a course the system send a mail from google servers to all
students in AT&T that the admin/lectur add a new course that they can se if they want it, and more.
